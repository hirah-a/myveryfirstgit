        <p>Aliens built the Pyramids of Giza. Right? 
            Despite being built 4,500 years ago, without 
            much of the technologies and knowledge we have 
            access to now, the Pyramids of Giza still stand 
            strong as the oldest and last remaining wonder 
            of the ancient world. That’s a bit suspicious 
            but not the worst of it. How is it that the 
            Pyramids are all aligned to true north? Is it not
            weird all the Pyramids align to the constellation
            Orion?</p>

        <h2 id="maths">Funky Geometry</h2>
        
        <p>Some of the weirder questions lie in the geometry 
            of the Pyramids. When looking at the dimensions, 
            we find various mathematical constants and irrational
            numbers (numbers that cannot be written as the ratio
            of two integers) being thrown out such as pi, 
            defined as the ratio of a circle’s circumference 
            to its diameter. Why is this interesting? The first
            written evidence of irrational numbers was in 
            5 B.C., more than 2000 years after the Pyramids 
            were built. An accurate approximation to Pi would 
            have been discovered much later.</p>

        <p>However, it really isn’t as mysterious as we think. 
            Take the biggest one, the Great Pyramid aka the Pyramid
             of Khufu. Using the Egyptian unit of measure, the royal 
             cubit (cb), the four sides of the base make a square 
             with lengths of approximately 440cb and the height of 
             the pyramid is approximately 280cb. The ratio of the 
             side lengths to the height is 1.571, when doubled gives
              3.1429. This is very close to the value of pi we know, 
              approximately 3.14159. A similar accuracy of pi would 
              not be found till Archimedes in 3 B.C., almost 22 
              centuries later.</p>

    <div id="ans">
        <h2 class="subs"> How would the Egyptians have been able 
            to calculate this and why did they not document it? </h2>
        
        <p> The answer is almost too simple. A probable theory is 
            that they used a trundle wheel to measure when constructing 
            the pyramid. Having the diameter of the trundle wheel be a 
            royal cubit, for simplicity. Counting 280 rotations along 
            two edges of the pyramid base and then piling the stones 
            to get a 280 cubit height. Since the circumference of the 
            trundle wheel would equal (1 cubit x pi), it’s natural to 
            get an answer for pi in the ratio taken above. The use of
            the trundle also allowed for precise
            measurements in the construction of the pyramids.
            It’s possible the Egyptians didn’t realise this relation, 
            therefore did not document it.</p>

    <div id="more">
        <h2 class="subs"> Not mysterious enough? </h2>
        <p>Other irrational numbers, such as the Golden Ratio, also 
            appear in the geometry of the Pyramid to a surprisingly 
            accurate degree. The golden ratio is the ratio between two 
            numbers, a and b, with the property that the ratio of a + b 
            to a is the same ratio. It is famous for being commonly 
            found in nature in the form of the spiral shown in the 
            diagram. However, it is odd how accurately it is portrayed 
            in the Pyramid, and it isn’t well understood how this is the 
            case. It’s possible the most aesthetically pleasing ratio was
            used after a lot of trial and error with previous pyramids.</p>

    <div id="conc">
        <h2 class="subs">Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>It’s important to remember that the origins of modern 
            mathematics were to explain phenomena in the natural world.
             So, is it surprising that ideas discovered recently have 
             appeared throughout our past? Whether by mistake or from 
             our ancestor’s reliance on the natural world. It’s possible
              stars from Big Dipper and Little Dipper were used to find 
              true North. The Egyptians were very into their astronomy 
              and designed the layout of the pyramids to correspond to 
              the stars. And maybe the Pyramids weren’t built by aliens.</p>
