        <h1>Funky Geometry</h1>

        <div> 
            
            <p>Some of the weirder questions lie in the geometry 
                of the Pyramids. When looking at the dimensions, 
                we find various mathematical constants and irrational
                numbers (numbers that cannot be written as the ratio
                of two integers) being thrown out such as pi, 
                defined as the ratio of a circle’s circumference 
                to its diameter. Why is this interesting? The first
                written evidence of irrational numbers was in 
                5 B.C., more than 2000 years after the Pyramids 
                were built. An accurate approximation to Pi would 
                have been discovered much later.</p>

            <p>However, it really isn’t as mysterious as we think. 
                Take the biggest one, the Great Pyramid aka the Pyramid
                 of Khufu. Using the Egyptian unit of measure, the royal 
                 cubit (cb), the four sides of the base make a square 
                 with lengths of approximately 440cb and the height of 
                 the pyramid is approximately 280cb. The ratio of the 
                 side lengths to the height is 1.571, when doubled gives
                  3.1429. This is very close to the value of pi we know, 
                  approximately 3.14159. A similar accuracy of pi would 
                  not be found till Archimedes in 3 B.C., almost 22 
                  centuries later.</p>
