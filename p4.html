        <p>Other irrational numbers, such as the Golden Ratio, also 
            appear in the geometry of the Pyramid to a surprisingly 
            accurate degree. The golden ratio is the ratio between two 
            numbers, a and b, with the property that the ratio of a + b 
            to a is the same ratio. It is famous for being commonly 
            found in nature in the form of the spiral shown in the 
            diagram. However, it is odd how accurately it is portrayed 
            in the Pyramid, and it isn’t well understood how this is the 
            case. It’s possible the most aesthetically pleasing ratio was
            used after a lot of trial and error with previous pyramids.</p>
