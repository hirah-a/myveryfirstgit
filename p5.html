    <h1>Why is it important?</h1>

    <div> 
        
        <p>It’s important to remember that the origins of modern 
            mathematics were to explain phenomena in the natural world.
             So, is it surprising that ideas discovered recently have 
             appeared throughout our past? Whether by mistake or from 
             our ancestor’s reliance on the natural world. It’s possible
              stars from Big Dipper and Little Dipper were used to find 
              true North. The Egyptians were very into their astronomy 
              and designed the layout of the pyramids to correspond to 
              the stars. And maybe the Pyramids weren’t built by aliens.</p>
